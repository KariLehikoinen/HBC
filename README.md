For the Human Brain Connectivity course, spring 2017

What I would like to learn:
1. Theory about brain connectivity research: what are it's *advantages* and *disadvantages*.
2. How it compares to more traditional fMRI analysis.
3. Analysis in practice: software and tools and such.
4. Practical considerations for running experiments: are there any, if you want do connectivity analysis?

I'm currently still a master's student so I have no huge ideas about what areas of connectivy I'd like to study especially, but I'm working as a research assistant in a project that studies language learning, where I might be able to put this knowledge to use.
